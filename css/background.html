        <h1>Time for a story</h1>
        <p>One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in the courtroom puzzled. As they all
            tried to figure out the answer, Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was. They repeated the question
            to him.<br>

            The question was, “How many crows are there in the city?”<br>

            Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar. He announced the answer; he said there were twenty-one
            thousand, five hundred and twenty-three crows in the city. When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal
            replied, “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are more, then the relatives of the crows must
            be visiting them from nearby cities. If there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be visiting their
            relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the answer, Akbar presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl
            chain. <br></p>
