            The wolf (Canis lupus[b]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and
            North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as
            popularly
            understood, comprise wild subspecies<sup><a href="https://google.com">{2}</a></sup>. The wolf is the largest
            extant member of the family Canidae. It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed
            ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a
            longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and
            the
            golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.<br>
            The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic
            region may be nearly all white.<br>

                Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as
                demonstrated
                by
                its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced
                expressive
                behaviour including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated
                pair
                accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual
                maturity
                and
                in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over
                territory
                are
                among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild
                hooved
                mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.<br>
                s Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs.
                Pathogens
                and
                parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect wolves.<br>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>

        <p>
            The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the
            Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for
            the
            animal lupus (*lúkʷos).[5][6] The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.[7]<br>

            Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in
            their
            names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"), Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"), Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard
            ("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone") Æðelwulf ("Noble Wolf"), Wolfhroc
            ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf Hide"), Scrutolf ("Garb Wolf"), Wolfgang ("Wolf Gait") and Wolfdregil
            ("Wolf
            Runner").<br>

        finally it gave up the persuit towards the grapes<br>
